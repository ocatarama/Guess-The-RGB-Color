# Guess-The-RGB-Color
ðŸ“œAn easy game in which you have to guess the color an RGB code indicates. Made with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

ðŸ“ŒRules are simple! In the header there is a RGB code written on the orange background.

âœ¨Six different colors are shown on the game board. Guess what color does the code from the header indicates! Every right guess grants you 10 points and sends you to another level. Every wrong guess takes 5 points from you.

âœ¨When you guess wrong, the box you pressed will disappear and you will have the chance to take another guess. But watch your points!
